# Phase 1:

- make database: DONE
- database access/lookup functions: DONE
- API for wallet aggregation through token holders:
- add holders to omni.db using db.py: 
- Filter for wallets with multiple appearances:
- Manually make a list of some smart wallets:
- Then programatically make a list of all smart wallets and check if the manual ones appear:
- If manual list appears, continue, else go back and tweak criterion:
- Function using external API for PnL:
- Confluence check

### Known problems / Plan

- No support yet for tracking historic holders
- Limited by availability/consistency of public APIs
- No deduplication of wallets that may be the same entity
- No token-level performance tracking yet
